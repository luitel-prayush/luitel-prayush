I'm a Backend Software Developer and Consultant at CGI Inc., where I currently work on mission-critical systems for a major financial institution. My role involves building scalable, high-performance backend services that support secure and reliable digital experiences for millions of users.

From the start of my career, I have been driven by a deep curiosity about how technology works. Over time, this interest evolved into a focused passion for cybersecurity and secure software development. I’m particularly interested in areas like application security, secure API design, threat modeling, and DevSecOps practices. I actively seek opportunities to expand my knowledge in these domains, whether through personal projects, certifications, or ongoing research.

Through my work, I aim to bridge the gap between software engineering and cybersecurity — helping build systems that are not only functional and scalable but also resilient to today’s evolving threat landscape.

## Objective

My background in computer science and backend software development has naturally evolved into a deep interest in cybersecurity. Through hands-on experience building systems for high-stakes environments, I’ve come to appreciate the critical role security plays in every layer of technology. I'm now focused on transitioning into the cybersecurity field, with a strong interest in roles such as Security Analyst or Security Engineer. My goal is to apply my development expertise, analytical mindset, and growing security skillset to help organizations build secure, resilient systems from the ground up.
